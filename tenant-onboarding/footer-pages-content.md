## 1. ABOUT PAGE

### Hero Section
**Heading:** We believe every small business deserves a beautiful online store

**Subheading:** Tesseract Hub makes it simple for creators, makers, and small business owners to sell online—without the technical headaches or hidden fees.

---

### Our Story Section
**Heading:** How We Started

We built Tesseract Hub because we saw too many talented people struggling with the same problem: they had amazing products but couldn't afford the expensive platforms, transaction fees, and developers needed to sell online.

We knew there had to be a better way. So we created a platform that's powerful enough for growth, simple enough to set up in an afternoon, and fair enough that you keep more of what you earn.

---

### Mission Section
**Heading:** Our Mission

We're here to level the playing field. Whether you're a baker selling custom cakes, an artist selling prints, or a maker selling handcrafted goods, you deserve the same quality tools that big brands use—without the enterprise price tag.

We believe in:
- **Simplicity over complexity** - You shouldn't need a developer to launch your store
- **Fairness over fees** - No transaction fees means you keep what you earn
- **Support over automation** - Real humans, available 24/7, whenever you need help
- **Quality over shortcuts** - We build with modern technology that's fast, secure, and reliable

---

### Team Philosophy Section
**Heading:** How We Work

We're a small team that believes technology should serve people, not the other way around. We don't chase trends—we focus on building tools that actually help you grow your business.

Every feature we build starts with a simple question: "Will this help our customers sell more and stress less?" If the answer isn't a clear yes, we don't build it.

We're not trying to be the biggest platform. We're trying to be the best partner for small businesses who want to thrive online.
