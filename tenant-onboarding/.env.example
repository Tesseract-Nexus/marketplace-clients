# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# ==================================
# Backend Service URLs (Server-Side)

# These are used by Next.js API routes to proxy requests to backend services
# IMPORTANT: These should NEVER be exposed to the client (no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)

# Tenant Service - Handles onboarding sessions, business info, verification
TENANT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8086

# Location Service - Handles countries, states, currencies, timezones
LOCATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8087

# ==================================
# Post-Onboarding Redirect

# Ecommerce Admin URL - Users are redirected here after completing onboarding
# This can be different based on environment (dev/staging/prod)

# NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_api_key_here

# Notes
# ==================================
# - Frontend uses Next.js API routes at /api/* (BFF pattern)
# - Backend service URLs are only accessible server-side
# - No CORS configuration needed on Go services
# - Client-side code calls /api/* which proxies to backend services
