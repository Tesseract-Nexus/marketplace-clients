## What to Expect Section

### Heading: What you'll find here (once we launch)

**Practical Guides**
Step-by-step walkthroughs that actually help. How to price your products, write descriptions that sell, take better product photos with your phone – that kind of thing.

**Store Owner Stories**
Real businesses sharing what worked, what didn't, and what they wish they'd known earlier. No sugarcoating, no humble brags – just honest experiences.

**Platform Updates**
New features explained in plain English. Why we built them, how to use them, and what problem they solve.

**Industry Insights**
E-commerce trends worth paying attention to. We'll skip the buzzwords and focus on what actually matters for small businesses.

**Behind the Scenes**
What it's like building Tesserix. Our wins, our mistakes, and why we make the decisions we make.
